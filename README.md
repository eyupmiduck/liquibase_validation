# liquibase_validation

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/eyupmiduck/liquibase_validation/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/eyupmiduck/liquibase_validation)

Test logic to validate Liquibase changelogs and changesets, and to statically
analyse PL/pgSQL routines with the `plpgsql_check` extension.

## Contents

- `io.github.eyupmiduck.changelogvalidator.ChangelogValidator` — traverses a
  changelog graph from its master file, following nested `<include>` elements,
  and finds invalidly named changeSets and SQL files as well as orphaned SQL
  files. SQL is recognised both in `<sqlFile>` elements and as the external
  body of a `<createProcedure>`/`<createFunction>` element; files under a
  routine directory (`functions`, `procedures`, or their `-rollback` variants)
  are exempt from the `NNN-` SQL naming rule.
- `io.github.eyupmiduck.changelogvalidator.PlpgsqlCheck` — runs
  `plpgsql_check` over the PL/pgSQL routines in a set of schemas and validates
  the findings against an allow-list, reporting unexpected findings and stale
  entries. The database must have the `plpgsql_check` extension installed.
- `io.github.eyupmiduck.changelogvalidator.AuditColumnsCheck` — checks the
  audit-column convention on a set of schemas: every base table has
  `created_at` and `updated_at`, both `timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`, with
  an enabled `BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger. A behavioral probe can
  verify on a real row that an `UPDATE` refreshes `updated_at` and preserves
  `created_at`, rolling the change back.

## Using the library

The library is published to GitHub Packages from a `v*` tag (for example
`v0.11.0`), and each artifact version is immutable:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.eyupmiduck</groupId>
    <artifactId>liquibase-validation</artifactId>
    <version>0.11.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Consuming builds must be authenticated to GitHub Packages even for public
packages. Add the repository to the consuming POM:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/eyupmiduck/liquibase_validation</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And provide credentials in `~/.m2/settings.xml` (a classic personal access
token with the `read:packages` scope is required):

```xml
<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>github</id>
            <username>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
            <password>YOUR_CLASSIC_PAT</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

Before a consuming repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` can read the package, grant
that repository read access under the package's **Manage Actions access**
settings.

## PL/pgSQL static analysis

`PlpgsqlCheck` runs `plpgsql_check_function_tb(..., all_warnings => true)` over
the routines in the given schemas and matches each finding against an
allow-list, so a build fails on an unexpected finding or a stale entry. A
trigger function is analysed through each relation its trigger is attached to;
an unattached trigger function is skipped, because the analyser needs a trigger
relation to resolve `NEW`/`OLD`.

```java
try (InputStream in = getClass().getClassLoader()
        .getResourceAsStream("plpgsql-check-whitelist.yml")) {
    List<PlpgsqlCheck.AllowedFinding> allowed = PlpgsqlCheck.loadWhitelist(in);
    PlpgsqlCheck.Report report = PlpgsqlCheck.check(connection, List.of("my_schema"), allowed);
    // report.unexpected() and report.stale() are empty when the check passes
}
```

The allow-list is YAML; each entry names any of `schema`, `function`, `level`,
`statement` and `message`, and an unset field matches any value:

```yaml
- schema: ddl_utils_lib
  function: alter_table
  level: security
  statement: EXECUTE
  message: text type variable is not sanitized
```

## Audit columns

`AuditColumnsCheck` enforces a project-wide audit-column convention. The catalog
check reports every base table that is missing `created_at`/`updated_at`, has
the wrong type, is nullable, does not default to `now()`, or lacks an enabled
`BEFORE UPDATE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger:

```java
List<AuditColumnsCheck.Violation> violations =
        AuditColumnsCheck.findViolations(connection, List.of("my_schema"));
// violations is empty when every table complies
```

The behavioral probe verifies the trigger actually works on a real row: it
updates one row's `updated_at` to a sentinel in the past and reads it back, so a
working trigger overwrites the sentinel and leaves `created_at` alone. The
update is rolled back, and a caller's in-flight transaction is preserved (the
probe uses a savepoint when the connection is not in autocommit mode):

```java
AuditColumnsCheck.probeUpdate(connection, "my_schema", "my_table")
        .ifPresent(probe -> {
            // probe.passed() is true when updated_at was refreshed and
            // created_at was preserved
        });
```

An empty table has no row to probe, so the result is empty.

## Releasing

1. Bump `<version>` in `pom.xml` (no `-SNAPSHOT` suffix).
2. Merge to `main`.
3. Push a matching tag, e.g. `git tag v0.11.0 && git push origin v0.11.0`.

The `Publish` workflow fails if the tag does not equal `v` + the POM version.
Consumer POMs must then be updated to the new version explicitly.

## Building

The `PlpgsqlCheck` tests start a PostgreSQL container (and build a small image
with the `plpgsql_check` package), so Docker must be running:

```sh
./mvnw verify
```
